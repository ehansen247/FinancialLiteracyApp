#  FFinancial Literacy App

## Introduction
A simple Personal Finance iOS App, developed using Swift and Xcode.

The app, "Cash Dash", can be launched by cloning the repository, opening the FinancialLiteracy.xcworkspace file, and running the XCode Simulator (select iPhone 8 as the simulated device). 

To build the app on a real device, connect an iPhone 6/7/8 and follow the following [tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2018/07/how-to-test-your-ios-application-on-a-real-device.html). 

## Components
The app contains 5 components: A dictionary, daily report, financial calculator, budgeting tool, and curriculum.

### Today's Report
Displays the top headline from Bloomberg Markets and daily change in the Dow Jones, NASDAQ, and the S&P 500 indices.

### Curriculum
The curriculum includes 10 different sections - credit, debt, retirement, savings/budgeting, etc. Navigate between sections to read information repackaged from sites like [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com "Investopedia Homepage").

### Dictionary
A scrollable table of 100 common financial terms. Includes a dynamic search bar allowing users to find terms within the table.
Click on the term's title to read its definition and star the term to include it in your Favorited tab.

### Financial Calculators
The financial calculator allows users to calculate simple/compound interest, cash flow, leverage ratio, and doubling time. 
Each calculation requires the user to fill in input fields. If you're unsure of what each field means, press explain to pull up a definition.

### Budget
The budget walkthrough allows the user to calculate their total income (Salary, Interest payments, etc.), total flexible and fixed expenses, and then see a final net income report.
